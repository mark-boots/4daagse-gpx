# 4Daagse GPX Deployment Instructions

## Quick Reference

### Two-Step Workflow (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Backend Processing
```powershell
.\scripts\generate.ps1
```
- Converts KML files to GPX
- Copies files to `docs/` folder
- **No deployment yet** - gives you time to review

#### Step 2: Review & Deploy
```powershell
# Review/edit files in docs/ folder if needed
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 "Your commit message"
```
- Commits and pushes to GitHub
- Site goes live in 2-10 minutes

## Common Workflows

### üó∫Ô∏è Adding New KML Files
```powershell
# 1. Add new .kml files to kmlfiles/ folder
# 2. Process backend
.\scripts\generate.ps1

# 3. Review generated files in docs/ folder
# 4. Make any frontend changes (colors, labels, etc.)
# 5. Deploy when ready
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 "Added 2026 route data"
```

### üé® Frontend Changes Only
```powershell
# 1. Edit docs/index.html directly
# 2. Deploy
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 "Updated sidebar colors"
```

### üß™ Test Before Deploy
```powershell
# 1. Make changes
.\scripts\generate.ps1  # (if needed)

# 2. Test locally
.\scripts\test-local.ps1
# Opens http://localhost:8000 - press Ctrl+C to stop

# 3. Deploy when satisfied
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 "Tested and ready"
```

### ‚ö° Automated with Review Pause
```powershell
.\scripts\update-routes.ps1 "Added new routes"
# Script will pause after generating files
# Press any key when ready to deploy
```

---

## File Locations

- **Source KML files**: `kmlfiles/` folder
- **Generated GPX files**: `public/gpx/` folder (intermediate)
- **Website files**: `docs/` folder (what gets deployed)
- **Automation scripts**: `scripts/` folder (PowerShell and batch files)
- **Live website**: https://mark-boots.github.io/4daagse-gpx/

---

## Important Notes

‚úÖ **Always edit files in `docs/` folder** - not `public/`  
‚úÖ **Changes go live automatically** after `git push`  
‚úÖ **GitHub Pages takes 2-10 minutes** to deploy  
‚úÖ **Check deployment status**: https://github.com/mark-boots/4daagse-gpx/actions  
‚úÖ **Hard refresh browser** (Ctrl+F5) to see changes immediately  

---

## Troubleshooting

### Site not updating?
- Check GitHub Actions for deployment status
- Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)

### PowerShell execution policy error?
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Want to undo last deployment?
```powershell
git revert HEAD
git push
```
